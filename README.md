# Settlers of Catan

This project tries to implement the game "Settlers Of Catan" as an online-based multiplayer game,
in which a total of four players will be able to connect to a server and play the game.

For simplicity, a few elements of the original game will not be implemeneted in this version, i.e. the Robber and trading.

## Development Environment

The project has been developed primarily in the IDE Eclipse Mars, with the implementation of the game library known as Slick2D. This library has been used for more simple programming for basic game properties, such as updating and rendering game elements.
